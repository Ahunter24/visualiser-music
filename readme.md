-P5.js
-Web audio API

## What resources did I use to build this project?

-Web Audio API documentation

## Microphone animation

Using the p5 library we create  a new microphone object. We then take the live audio input from that object to animate the volume received. Please note due to users needing to give permission to enable their microphone this project wont work on chrome browsers on iphone.

## FFT Analysis

FFT is an analysis algorithm that isolates individual audio frequencies.

## Hosting
